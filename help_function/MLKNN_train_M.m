%    Description
%
%      MLKNN_train_M takes,
%           train_data    - An num_data x num_dim array, the ith instance of training instance is stored in train_data(i,:)
%           train_target  - A num_label x num_data array, if the ith training instance belongs to the jth class, then train_target(j,i) equals +1, otherwise train_target(j,i) equals 0
%           num_neighbour - Number of neighbors used in the k-nearest neighbor algorithm
%           Smooth        - Smoothing parameter
%           M             - Distance metric
%      and returns,
%           Prior         - A num_label x 1 array, for the ith label Ci, the prior probability of P(Ci) is stored in Prior(i,1)
%           PriorN        - A num_label x 1 array, for the ith label Ci, the prior probability of P(~Ci) is stored in PriorN(i,1)
%           Cond          - A num_label x (num_neighbour + 1) array, for the ith label Ci, the probability of P(k|Ci) (0<=k<=num_neighbour) i.e. k nearest neighbors of an instance in Ci will belong to Ci , is stored in Cond(i,k+1)
%           CondN         - A num_label x (num_neighbour + 1) array, for the ith label Ci, the probability of P(k|~Ci) (0<=k<=num_neighbour) i.e. k nearest neighbors of an instance not in Ci will belong to Ci, is stored in CondN(i,k+1)
