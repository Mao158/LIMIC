%   Description
%
%       MLKNN_predict_M takes,
%           test_data     - An num_test x num_dim array,the ith instance of testing instances is stored in test_data(i, :)
%           train_data    - An num_train x num_dim array, the ith instance of training instances is stored in train_data(i, :)
%           train_target  - An num_label x num_train array, if the ith instance of training instances belongs to the jth class, then train_labels(j, i) equals to +1, otherwise train_label(i, j) equals to 0
%           num_neighbour - Number of neighbors used in the k-nearest neighbor algorithm
%           Prior         - A num_label x 1 array, the prior probability P[Hj] representing the probability that an instance belongs to the jth class is stored in Prior(j, 1)
%           PriorN        - A num_label x 1 array, the prior probability P[~Hj] representing the probability that an instance does not belong to the jth class is stored in PriorN(j, 1)
%           Cond          - A num_label x (num_neighbour + 1) array, the likelihood P[k|Hj] representing the probability that k neighbors of an instance belonging to the jth class belong to the jth class is stored in Cond(j, k)
%           CondN         - A num_label x (num_neighbour + 1) array, the likelihood P[k|~Hj] representing the probability that k neighbors of an instance not belonging to the jth class belong to the jth class is stored in CondN(j, k)
%           M             - Distance metric
%       and returns,
%           Pre_Labels    - An num_label x num_test array, if the ith instance of testing instances belongs to the jth class, then Pred_label(j, i) equals to +1, otherwise Pred_label(j, i) equals to -1
%           Outputs       - An num_label x num_test array, the probability of the ith instance of testing instances belonging to the jth class is stored in Pred_porb(j, i)
